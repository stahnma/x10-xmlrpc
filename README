A simple XMLRPC server written in Ruby to control my X10 setup.

This probably won't be useful to anybody else.  Oh well.


= Requirements = 
Have Ruby 1.8 or greater installed. 


Modify the variables in the xmlrpc-server.rb script to fit your environment.

Setup SSH key authentication from your XMLRPC server system to the X10 controller system. 

Run the xmlrpc-server.rb script.  It will spawn WEBrick and my really simple XMLRPC server. 

Write an appropriate client.  A client is included, but it is extremely basic.  

= TODO =
Add Error Handling.  Like any. 
Probably break out remote vs local calls for X10.  In my test case all calls were remote.
